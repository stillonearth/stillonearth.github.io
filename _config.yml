      description: >
        The university laid emphasis on laboratory instruction in applied science and engineering, specific to demands of the aerospace industry.
        During my years at MAI I have learned foundational skills related of computer modelling applied to aeronautics and space. My specialization was in Global Satellite Navigation Systems (GNSS) and final qualification project was about Indoor Navigation. Later this grew into company named Shopster.

          Indoor Navigation and footfall Analytics with WiFi singal probing.
          Shopster grew as a continuation of my University diploma. Idea was that people get lost in malls and solution was to use ambient wireless signals to build indoor mapping with particle filters. Ambient magnetic fields were added as another rich singal source later. Company eventualy pivoted into commercial foot traffic analytics and now is being used by malls and reatail stores.

          Ostrovok.ru is a Russian online hotel booking service, founded in 2010 by Serge Faguet and Kirill Makharinsky. It has over one million accommodation options. 
          During my time at Ostrovok I've learned what proper tech company should be, how important company culture is and what Google-esqe values are. I've been mostly involved with programming web with python.
